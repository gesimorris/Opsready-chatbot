# Project Overview
This project is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that allows Claude to interact with internal company data
such as:
- Workspaces
- Deficiencies
- Tasks
- Assets
- Work Orders
- Activity
- Teams
- Accounts

It exposes a set of tools, which are API endpoints to Claude, so Claude can call and retrieve structured data and perform
queries. This enables a conversational style interface that allows users to get answers and insights into their operational data.
